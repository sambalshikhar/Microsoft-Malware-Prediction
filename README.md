# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
A Multi-class classification problem

## Business/Real-world Problem
 What is Malware?
The term malware is a contraction of malicious software. Put simply, malware is any piece of software that was written with the intent
of doing harm to data, devices or to people.

## Problem Statement
In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade
traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these
attacks. The major part of protecting a computer system from a malware attack is to identify whether a given piece of file/software
is a malware.
## Source/Useful Links
Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over
150 million computers around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential
malware. In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them
into groups and identify their respective families.
This dataset provided by Microsoft contains about 9 classes of malware. ,

## Real-world/Business objectives and constraints.
1. Minimize multi-class error.
2. Multi-class probability estimates.
3. Malware detection should not take hours and block the user's computer. It should fininsh in a few seconds or a minute
